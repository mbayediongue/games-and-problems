# games-and-problems

This repository contains the imlementation of classical games and problems. Most part of the code was written as part of my artificial intelligence course at Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne. Adversarial tree search algorithms (minimax, alpha beta pruning, alpha-beta deepening) and other heuristic methods are essentially used.

## Adversarial-search

This sub-folder folder contains a model of the [tic-tac-toe game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) (called also 'morpion' or '3 pions'), the [connect four game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four)('puissance 4') and the [nim game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim) using adversarial search algorithms: Minimax, Alpha-Beta pruning and Iterative deepening.
