# games-and-problems
This repository contains the imlementation of classical games and problems. Most part of the code was written as part of my artificial intelligence course at Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne. Adversarial tree search algorithms (minimax, alpha beta pruning, alpha-beta deepening) and other heuristic methods are essentially used.
